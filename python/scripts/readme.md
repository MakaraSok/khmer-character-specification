# Python Scripts

This directory contains various python scripts that help with managing Khmer
encoded text.

## khnormal

This script normalizes Khmer text according to the proposed normal encoding
structure. It does not attempt to identify faulty text, merely to ensure that
two strings that would have rendered the same are output as the same string.

The script has a short application at the end. Run the script with no
arguments for the summary help.
