# Khmer Character Specification/Usages

## What is this?
This document seeks to describe how the Khmer script is used in the following languages:
1. Khmer language,
2. ethnic minority languages,
3. Pali and
4. Sanskrit.

## Why?
There is always a gap between the developer communities and the linguistic communities when it comes to Khmer character specification or usages. The aim is to fill in the gap when it comes to the use of Khmer characters.
